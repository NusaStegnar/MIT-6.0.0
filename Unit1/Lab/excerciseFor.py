# Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive.

# So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result: 
# 21 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
# For problems such as these, do not include input statements or define variables we will provide for you. 
# Our automating testing will provide values so write your code in the 
# following box assuming these variables are already defined.
