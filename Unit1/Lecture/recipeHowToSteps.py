square root of a number x is y
y * y = x

# recipe for deducing square root of number x (e.g. 16)

start with a guess g
if g  *g is close enough to x, stop and say g is the answer
otherwise make a new guess by averaging g and x / y
using the new guess, repeat the process until close enough

# recipe
sequence of simple steps
flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
a means to determining when to StopAsyncIteration

Steps 1 + 2 + 3 = an algorithm!!!
