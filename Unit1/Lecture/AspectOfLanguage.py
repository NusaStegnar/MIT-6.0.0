syntax

◦ English: "cat dog boy"  not syntactically valid
            "cat hugs boy"  syntactically valid

◦ programming language: "hi"5  not syntactically valid
                        3.2*5  syntactically valid

static semantics is which syntactically valid strings have 
meaning

◦ English: "I are hungry"  syntactically valid but static semantic error

◦ programming language: 3.2*5  syntactically valid
                        3+"hi"  static semantic error

semantic errors

◦ English: can have many meanings –
◦ “Flying planes can be dangerous” 
◦ “This reading lamp hasn’t uttered a word since I bought it?”

◦ programming languages: have only one meaning but may not be what programmer intended
