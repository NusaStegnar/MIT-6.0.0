# CREATE STRUCTURE with DECOMPOSITION
# in example, separate devices
# in programming, divide code into modules 
    # • are self-contained
    # • used to break up code
    # • intended to be reusable
    # • keep code organized
    # • keep code coherent
# achieve decomposition with functions
# achieve decomposition with classes


# SUPPRESS DETAILS with ABSTRACTION
# in example, no need to know how to build a projector
# in programming, think of a piece of code as a black box
    # • cannot see details
    # • do not need to see details
    # • do not want to see details
    # • hide tedious coding details
# achieve abstraction with function specifications or docstrings
