# Exercise: fourth power
# Write a Python function, fourthPower, that takes in one number 
# and returns that value raised to the fourth power.
# You should use the square procedure that you defined in an earlier exercise 
# (you don't need to redefine square in this box; when you call square, the grader will use our definition).
